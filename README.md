**Contents:**
_Reference genomes_
  • Database customization: Selection of species-representative microbial genomes based on quality and host origin for downstream mapping and genome annotations.
  • Gene and pseudogene annotation: Annotate gene content and identify potentially truncated or fragmented genes.
  • Trait prediction: Predict oxygen and temperature tolerances based on genome sequence.
  • Build phylogenetic tree: Mashtree construction of phylogeny from microbial reference genomes.

_Metagenome profiling_
  • Pre-processing: Remove adapters and trim reads based on quality scores.
  • inStrain: Profile strains based on average nucleotide identity.
  • SynTracker: Profile strains based on microsynteny.
