# Using SynTracker to assess strain sharing based on microsynteny

## Assemble contigs from metagenomic reads with megahit (v1.2.9)
### forward = path to forward reads
### reverse = path to reverse reads
megahit -1 $forward -2 $reverse -o assemblies/$sample

## Run SynTracker (v1.4.0) on all samples
### dereplicated_genomes = path to folder with 4712 species-representative genomes selected for database
python syntracker.py -target assemblies/ -ref $dereplicated_genomes -out $syntracker_out -length 2500 --identity 95
